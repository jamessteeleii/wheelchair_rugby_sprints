This project uses
[`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#reproducibility):

- `renv::snapshot()` save state
- `renv::restore()` load state

where state refers to package versions used by the project.

## Targets analysis pipeline

This project also uses a function based analysis pipeline using
[`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)

Useful console functions:

- `tar_edit()` opens a the make file
- `tar_make()` to run targets
- `tar_visnetwork()` to view pipeline

You can view the current interactive pipeline by clicking [here](visnetwork.html).
